<h2 style="background-color:Orange;color:white;font-family:verdana;">Personal Information</h2>

<p style="background-color:RGB(255,230,160);color:rgb(102,51,0);font-family:verdana;">Hi, my name is Wei Cui, my student number is s3903904, student email s3903904@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
<p style="background-color:RGB(255,230,160);color:rgb(102,51,0);font-family:verdana;">I’m from China, after finished working holiday I decided to stay here to study, “knowledge is power” Chinese say. I have bachelor degree of Animation, also worked in the filed for 10 years, I made animation for TV cartoon and online games. </p>
<p style="background-color:RGB(255,230,160);color:rgb(102,51,0);font-family:verdana;">after I left my family to live independently, finally I got a chance to cook! my Mum won’t let me use her kitchen, she thought I’ll burn it. Thanks to IT I can learn cooking by watching tons of videos online, now I’m very confident that I can beat my Mum! </p>
<p style="background-color:RGB(255,230,160);color:rgb(102,51,0);font-family:verdana;">I also enjoy watching cartoons and animate, I have a whole bookshelf of comic books back in China.</p>
<p style="background-color:RGB(255,230,160);color:rgb(102,51,0);font-family:verdana;">Travel is my other hobby, I’ve been to Russia,Iran, Thai, Laos, NewZealand ect.</p>

<h2 style="background-color:Tomato;color:white;font-family:verdana;">Interest in IT</h2>
<p style="background-color:RGB(255,193,180);color:rgb(51,0,0);font-family:verdana;">When I was working in an online game company, I began to notice the job the developers and testers doing, I listened to what them talk during meeting even though I had no idea about it, but as time gone by I made friends with some of them, I asked them about their jobs and they were happy to answer.slowly I’ve grown interested in it, I began to understand the logic behind our games, how this game process step by step.</p>
<p style="background-color:RGB(255,193,180);color:rgb(51,0,0);font-family:verdana;">although I still love making animation, learn IT has become one of my dreams. maybe I can combine animation and programming to make a new way to make animation! I knew people are doing it already! need to catch up!</p>
<p style="background-color:RGB(255,193,180);color:rgb(51,0,0);font-family:verdana;">After I decided to study in Australia, I did lots of research, thanks again to IT, I can access informations of schools easily, I think RMIT is professional and practical, also end up with a bachelor degree. 
I hope I can systematically study the fundament of IT, understand the magic behind modern technology. also be able to program is a professional fashion.</p>

<p style="background-color:RGB(204,255,153);color:rgb(0,51,0);font-family:verdana;">This is an APP for workout, more and more people realised how important to have a good healthy body, they want to workout but they don’t know what to do or how to plan, other app in market is not flexible enough to match different level of workout requirement, this app will help them to choose and with easy operation, everyone can have their own plan and motivation.

<p style="background-color:RGB(204,255,153);color:rgb(0,51,0);font-family:verdana;">the APP will recommend exercise style and plan according to user’s goal, we have yoga lesson, cross-fit, weight lifting, pregnancy exercise , new starter, lose-weight exercise and relaxing workout. after user enter their height, weight, age, and their goal, the system will make some plan mix different type of exercise to let them choose or they can make a plan themselves, for example user can add different exercise to their cross-fit, set up exercise time and rest time of each workout, they can also link music from other APP, and count down sound effect. In yoga lesson, video of professional teacher will show the move and tell user how to do it.</p>

<p style="background-color:RGB(204,255,153);color:rgb(0,51,0);font-family:verdana;">There are activities online every week or month, like“200 mins yoga challenge” or “workout everyday for a month challenge”. user get reward if they succeed, for example user get coupons can be use within the app. or get a yoga mat from sponsors which put AD in the APP.</p>
<p style="background-color:RGB(204,255,153);color:rgb(0,51,0);font-family:verdana;">The APP can be used on phone and table,  both Android and Apple system, we use Java, Sketch,Adobe Experience Design and Adobe Illustration to do UI design.</p>
