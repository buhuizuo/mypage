<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p style="background-color:RGB(255,230,160);color:rgb(102,51,0);font-family:verdana;"&gt;Hi, my name is Wei Cui, my student number is s3903904, student email s3903904@student.rmit.edu.au&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p style="background-color:RGB(255,230,160);color:rgb(102,51,0);font-family:verdana;"&gt;I’m from China, after finished working holiday I decided to stay here to study, “knowledge is power” Chinese say. I have bachelor degree of Animation, also worked in the filed for 10 years, I made animation for TV cartoon and online games. &lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p style="background-color:RGB(255,230,160);color:rgb(102,51,0);font-family:verdana;"&gt;after I left my family to live independently, finally I got a chance to cook! my Mum won’t let me use her kitchen, she thought I’ll burn it. Thanks to IT I can learn cooking by watching tons of videos online, now I’m very confident that I can beat my Mum! &lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p style="background-color:RGB(255,230,160);color:rgb(102,51,0);font-family:verdana;"&gt;I also enjoy watching cartoons and animate, I have a whole bookshelf of comic books back in China.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p style="background-color:RGB(255,230,160);color:rgb(102,51,0);font-family:verdana;"&gt;Travel is my other hobby, I’ve been to Russia,Iran, Thai, Laos, NewZealand ect.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;h2 style="background-color:Tomato;color:white;font-family:verdana;"&gt;Interest in IT&lt;/h2&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p style="background-color:RGB(255,193,180);color:rgb(51,0,0);font-family:verdana;"&gt;When I was working in an online game company, I began to notice the job the developers and testers doing, I listened to what them talk during meeting even though I had no idea about it, but as time gone by I made friends with some of them, I asked them about their jobs and they were happy to answer.slowly I’ve grown interested in it, I began to understand the logic behind our games, how this game process step by step.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p style="background-color:RGB(255,193,180);color:rgb(51,0,0);font-family:verdana;"&gt;although I still love making animation, learn IT has become one of my dreams. maybe I can combine animation and programming to make a new way to make animation! I knew people are doing it already! need to catch up!&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p style="background-color:RGB(255,193,180);color:rgb(51,0,0);font-family:verdana;"&gt;After I decided to study in Australia, I did lots of research, thanks again to IT, I can access informations of schools easily, I think RMIT is professional and practical, also end up with a bachelor degree.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I hope I can systematically study the fundament of IT, understand the magic behind modern technology. also be able to program is a professional fashion.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
